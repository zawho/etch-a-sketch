Monday, September 12, 2022 - I am now starting the Etch A Sketch project near the end of the Javascript portion of the The Odin Project's Foundations track. I will be building a web app that functions as a sketching game. In doing so, I will be implementing all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills I have learned thus far, as well as probably learning to do a few new things in the process.

Wednesday, September 28, 2022 - Finished the Etch A Sketch project. I added some extra functionality outside of what TOP asked for, including an RGB color selector, eraser, and background color fill, finished with a simple CSS style and layout. I learned a lot over the course of this project, particularly about new ways to use event listeners, function scope, and just generally getting many moving parts to work together. It was fun!
